# Arduino-Based-BOT

It is a 4-wheeled remote-control sorry mobile control through voice commands bot with awesome performance completely made from scratch materials with high innovative thinking being put on the bot to make it highly optimised and reliable.

To make it from scratch go through the given pdf. If you can't understand the meaning of some sentences after going through the pdf I am really sorry for that because it was developed back in 2018 as an academic project in our diploma course at that time we were really stugling with English. I hope you have understood the project.Thank you!
